# Javscript Calculator... Again!  But with SERVERS (whaaaaaa)


![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1YbqghcGURhrq/giphy.gif)

##The Goal:
Make a javascript calculator using the routes from a Node/Express server.  A user should be able to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and lastly of course, calculate the area of a circle.  You are given no starter code, and pretty styling is __not__ required.



for example:
* /add/5/2 should send '7' to the browser.
* /multiply/8/2 should send '16' to the browser.
* /subtract/10/5 should send '10' to the browser.
* /circle/4 should send '50.27' to the browser.

Obviously, users should be able to do these functions on __any__ number, not just the ones listed above.

##Specs:

Your app should include:
* a server.js file where you require all key depencies.
* seperate routes for each mathmatical function.
* a folder for views and a seperate view for each mathmatical function.


##Key Steps:
* make sure you npm install --save all necessary dependencies from the command line.
* require all the dependencies in the server.js file.
