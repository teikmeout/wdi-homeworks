# Let's Build a Website using HTML/CSS

### Introduction

Tonight, we are going to test out what we have been learning about HTML and CSS by building a portfolio website for our buddy, Joe Zonkey!

### Description

Imagine Mr. Zonkey is in the same place you will be a few months from now and is beginning to take on work as a freelance developer. So far he's done work for (imaginary) companies like Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and Citipix, and he wants to showcase the web apps and landing pages he's built for them. But he is just SO busy that he needs you to help build it for him. Take what you've learned from class and the pre-work and build a portfolio site using HTML and CSS that showcases his hard work.

Create two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another. The 'About Page' should describe Joe's mission and value proposition and the 'Portfolio' should include [screenshots](starter-code/images) with descriptions of the work you've done for the companies mentioned above. Don't worry if you can't come up with any text for the pages--we've provided you with [some sample copy](starter-code/sample-copy.txt) that you can use.

Don't forget to `git add` and `git commit` early and often. It's a good habit to get into. Make Bobby proud!

Be creative! Feel free to put your own spin on it.

### Requirements

- Link both pages together using `a` tag
- Use a unique `title` and a single unique `h1` tag
- Show images using `img` tags including unique `alt` attributes
- Use an external CSS stylesheet to style your pages
- Select at least 5 elements on the page and apply at least 5 different css properties (`font-size`, `color`, `font-family`, `background`, `text-decoration`) to these elements
- Use at least 6 different HTML tags (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `a`, `img`) on your pages
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across your .html and .css files
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability

### Bonus

- Experiment by adding additional HTML tags and CSS properties we did not cover in class - explore!

### Getting Started

* First go to Git.GeneralAssemb.ly and navigate to WDI NYC 60.
* Find the hw-w01-d02 repo and click on it.
* Fork this repo to your account.
* Click on the green 'Clone or download' button on the right and copy the SSH link.
* In terminal, navigate to `~/code/wdi/homework/` and type `git clone [YOUR SSH LINK]` and hit enter
* You should now have a hw-w01-d02 folder where you can create your work.

We've provided some [starter text](starter-code/sample-copy.txt) and [sample images](starter-code/images). You're going to build this assignment from scratch by creating index.html and style.css files and performing your work in there. Feel free to get creative with regard to layout, color, styling, etc.

### Deliverable

Here are examples of a simple "About" and "Portfolio" page that fulfill the assignment requirements:

- Joe, the freelance developer's "about page":
